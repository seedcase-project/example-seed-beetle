# Complex mitonuclear interactions and metabolic costs of mating in male seed beetles


Data from the 2015 on metabolic rate, respiratory quotient, body
weight and ejaculate weight data from seed beetles with different
mitonuclear genotypes.

This repository shows how to use the Seedcase Sprout tools on a data set
of seed beetle data. The data is from a study by [Immonen et al.
(2015)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jeb.12789) and is
available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/4932381).
